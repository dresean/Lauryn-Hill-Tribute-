Tribute Page to Lauryn Hill



<strong> This is one of many projects that I will use to strengthen my skills a a developer. </strong> 

I noticed my love for technology and design with the invention of social media. Myspace in particular made my interests peak.
I was unlike any other cookie cutter webdesign out there. Being able to manipulate the design and still use it as a means for 
communication was the catalyst that would soon spark my need for art and function.
